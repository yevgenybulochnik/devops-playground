Four virtual machines

1. LB   -> runs HAProxy to route all requests and acts as an SSH bastion
2. Web1 -> runs Wordpress and Magento 2 (blog.example.com and shop.example.com)
3. Web2 -> runs NodeBB (forum.example.com)
4. Data -> runs MongoDB and MySQL

                      Web1
                    /      \
User Request -> LB           Data
                    \      /
                      Web2

- A user should be able to clone the project and run `vagrant up`, then navigate their browser to any
  of the aforementioned web addresses and see the desired application
- The entire process should be automated.

- The project should handle modifying the users host file so `shop.example.com`, `blog.example.com`,
  and `forum.example.com` all resolve to the IP address of LB
- All four guest VM's should have their host file modified as well. No IP addresses should be used for
  any internal network connections or configuration, everything should be done by hostname

- There should be a user present on all four guests that matches the user who runs `vagrant up`
- The public SSH key on the users host (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) should be associated with the aforementioned
  user account on all four guests
- The user should be able to SSH into Web1, Web2, or Data, using LB as an 'SSH bastion host'
- The user should be able to access Web1, Web2, and Data from LB by hostname (`web1`, `web2`, and `data`, respectively)
-- Example: `ssh <username>@lb` -> `ssh web`
